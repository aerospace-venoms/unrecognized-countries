This project is a superficial overview of countries without recognition. The data came, mostly hand-copied, from wikipedia pages, and I use a Makefile to create the graph.

In general, I only noted countries that are recognized by at least half of the UN member states. In the graph, arrows point from an origin state to a state which the origin does not recognize.

TODO:
[-]Auto-scrape Wiki pages
[-]Define which countries
